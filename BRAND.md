# 🐧 Blorbo Brand System

Blorbo Frostingson is the official synthetic mascot across all projects.  
He is the unblinking node, the absurd connective tissue, the visual constant inside creative entropy.

These guidelines exist to **preserve his shape**, **clarify his usage**, and **prevent spiritual inconsistencies** across renderings.

---

## 🔩 Core Identity

Blorbo is:
- A stylized, simplified blorboin
- Emotionally unreadable
- A placeholder god
- A vessel for consistency in highly inconsistent environments

Key traits:
- **Expression:** Blank, soulless, slightly stupid stare (large round eyes, no spark)  
- **Beak:** Single oblong rectangle, solid color, **never separated**  
- **Body:** Rounded blob form, minimal detail, stubby flippers and feet  
- **Humor:** Comes from mismatch—his stare stays the same, regardless of costume or context

---

## 🎨 Visual Rules

### Color
- **White** – face/belly  
- **Baby blue** – body  
- **Light orange** – beak + feet  
- **Black** – outlines, eyes  
- **Optional Accent:** darker blue for depth/contrast (shadows or background)

### Line Style
- Bold outlines  
- Hand-drawn or hand-textured strokes  
- Slight wobble preferred over perfect symmetry  
- Avoid polished, corporate vector sheen

### Rendering Rules
- Keep canonical proportions: round eyes, rectangular beak, short squat body  
- Do not attempt realistic lighting or shading  
- Avoid giving Blorbo human musculature. It’s been tried. It failed.

---

## 🧱 Archetype System

Blorbo wears costumes and assumes archetypes based on project context.  
These are **modular overlays**, not transformations. His identity stays intact beneath.

All archetypes:
- Must be based on `/assets/stencils/`  
- Must retain Blorbo’s proportions, pose, and expression  
- Are considered canonical *only* when derived from stencil truth sources

Blorbo does not evolve.  
He merely *dresses for the job*.

## 👁️ Stencils

Located in `/assets/stencils/`

- **blorbo-eyes-open.svg**  
- **blorbo-eyes-closed.svg**  
- **aesus-demon-blorbo.svg** *(classified)*

These are master templates.  
Never modify them directly. Duplicate into `/variations/` before editing.

These are the shape. The law. The origin.

---

## 📛 File Naming Schema

```

blorbo-[category]-[descriptor].[ext]

```

### Categories
- `stencil` → master outlines  
- `variation` → costumes, archetypes  
- `export` → final renderings (banners, thumbnails, stickers)

### Descriptor Guidelines
- Use lowercase + hyphens  
- Avoid noise like `small`, `alpha`, `final-final`, unless versioning is absolutely necessary  
- Naming should hint at lore or context where possible

Example:  
- `blorbo-variation-viking-warrior.svg`  
- `blorbo-export-youtube-banner-final.png`  
- `blorbo-stencil-eyes-open.svg`

## 👀 Design Taboos (Soft Law)

Some things should not be done.  
Others were done, and we regret them.

- **Do not separate Blorbo’s beak.**  
- **Do not give Blorbo a mouth.**  
- **Blorbo should seldomly blink.**  
  - Not never. Just *rarely enough* to make it feel like an accident.

These rules are spiritual, not mechanical.  
Break them only with deep understanding and narrative justification.

---

## 💼 Usage Examples

- **GitHub** – repo icons, project mascots, README graphics  
- **YouTube** – banners, thumbnails, recurring visual anchors  
- **Stickers** – WhatsApp, Telegram, physical decals  
- **Merch** – Shirts, hoodies, zines, print collateral  
- **CLI Tools** – loading animations, avatar glyphs, terminal gremlins

If a project needs visual consistency or emotional absurdity, Blorbo can be inserted.
