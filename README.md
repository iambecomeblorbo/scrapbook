# 🐧 Blorbo

Blorbo is a synthetic mascot, a recursive brand cell, and a visual binder across all of my projects.

This repository is the **truth source**:  
It contains stencils, variations, renderings, exports, and soft law for Blorbo’s many forms.  
This is both a **brand kit** and a **scrapbook**.

> This is the canonical scrapbook of Blorbo Frostingson, a penguin of mild disposition who sometimes says big things by accident.


Blorbo is the glue. Blorbo is the vessel. Blorbo has no idea what’s happening.

## 🧠 What Is Blorbo?

Blorbo is:

* A stylized penguin (visually)
* A mascot (technically)
* A cross-project anchor (functionally)
* A god or a joke depending on render context (theologically)

He exists in different costumes, styles, and dimensions—but **his essence remains**.
His stare is blank. His posture: upright. His soul: unknowable.

He asks nothing of you, yet binds your visual systems together.

## 👁️ Design Taboos (Soft Law)

Some things should not be done.
Others already were.

* **Do not separate Blorbo’s beak.**
  (It has been done. The consequences persist.)

* **Do not give Blorbo a mouth.**
  (Yet he once spoke—in a 1950s mockup. That version is quarantined.)

* **Blorbo should seldomly blink.**
  Not never.
  Just rarely enough that it feels like a mistake… or a message.

These rules are more superstition than restriction.
You may break them—but only if you understand the cost.

## 🧱 Design Philosophy

Blorbo is governed by:

* **Absurd seriousness** — high technical craft, dumb little mascot
* **Controlled weirdness** — stylized but stable
* **Emotional deadpan** — always watching, never reacting

No matter the context, Blorbo is used:

* To unify multiple tools or identities
* To lighten tone without infantilizing
* To maintain an internal mythology across unrelated systems
