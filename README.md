# Blorbo: Brand Index & Visual Source

This repository serves as the canonical archive and design source for **Blorbo Frostingson**, a synthetic mascot and unifying visual identity across multiple projects. It contains verified stencils, variations, exports, renderings, and usage parameters for all officially recognized instances of Blorbo.

Blorbo is a recursive brand cell. He is a visual binder. He is not, strictly speaking, aware.

## Blorbo’s Function

Blorbo is:

* A stylized penguin (visually)
* A system mascot (operationally)
* A design anchor across tools (strategically)
* A symbolic entity with flexible theological status

His design is intentionally minimal, emotionally neutral, and narratively extensible. He is reused across technical and creative domains as a symbolic constant, despite (or because of) his lack of personal context.

## ⚠️ Design Constraints

These guidelines are enforced as **soft law**. Exceptions may exist but should be deliberate and narratively justified.

* **Do not separate Blorbo’s beak.**
  This undermines core shape recognition.

* **Do not assign Blorbo a mouth.**
  Exceptions exist in non-canonical media, which are explicitly deprecated.

* **Blinking should be rare.**
  Use sparingly to maintain affect flatness and minimize anthropomorphism.

Adherence to these constraints ensures design consistency across all projects using Blorbo as a symbolic or visual anchor.

## Application Use Cases

Blorbo may be used in the following contexts:

* Project branding (icons, mascots, thematic anchors)
* Documentation and UI unification
* Lightweight symbolic world-building across tools or domains
* Personal fan works and derivative art (with attribution)

The character is intentionally flexible in costume, scale, and role, but must retain core proportional features and signature expression. Blorbo is always stylized. Blorbo is never photorealistic.
